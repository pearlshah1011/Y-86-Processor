Y86 Processor Architecture Design using Verilog
Overview
This project involves the design and implementation of a processor architecture based on the Y86 Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) using Verilog. The primary objective is to develop both a bare minimum sequential design and a full-fledged pipelined architecture with support for hazard elimination.
