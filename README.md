# Y86 Processor Architecture Design using Verilog
## Overview
This project involves the design and implementation of a processor architecture based on the Y86 Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) using Verilog. The primary objective is to develop both a bare minimum sequential design and a full-fledged pipelined architecture with support for hazard elimination.
## Project Description
The project encompasses the development of a processor architecture capable of executing instructions from the Y86 ISA. It includes both a minimal sequential design and an optimized pipelined architecture to maximize performance. Additionally, comprehensive testing and verification methodologies have been employed to ensure the correctness and functionality of the designs.
